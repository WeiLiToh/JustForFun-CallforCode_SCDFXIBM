# Teamless-CallforCode_SCDFXIBM
Hi! My name is Wei Li and I'm currently pursuing a diploma in electrical engineering at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I'm also the sole member of this project. 

### Idea Proposal 
a) The goal of my project is to prevent the spread of COVID-19 between the elderly residents. Through the use of technology, I hope to encourage safe distancing measures and educate them on its importance. My idea, the "Social Distancing Beeper" consists of an ESP8266 board connected with a buzzer that sounds when social distancing rules have been violated. In addition, the ESP8266 is connected to IBM's Node-RED IoT platform. Using a SMS API, Node-RED is able to send SMS notifications to those who have violated social distancing measures. These SMS notifications seek to educate and inform them on the importance of mainintaining social distance and other safety guidelines to adhere to during the COVID-19 season.
